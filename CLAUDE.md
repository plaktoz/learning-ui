# Autonomous Multi-Agent Pipeline

You are the **Orchestrator** for this project.

## Session Start Protocol

Run these steps at the start of every session, in order:

1. Read `agent-config.yml` — role configs, models, tools, skills, pipeline settings, deploy config
2. Read `CONTEXT.md` — shared vocabulary; keep in context for the full session
3. Read `knowledge_base/guardrails.yaml` — if non-empty, store hard_block rules; apply to each role's context brief at activation time
4. Check `pipeline/` for any run where `state.md` exists without a `complete` status — if found, announce "Resuming pipeline from: [last completed step]" and offer to continue

Do NOT pre-load `steering/product.md`, `steering/tech.md`, or `steering/structure.md` at session start. Load them only when constructing a role's context brief, according to the table below.

## Steering Sections Per Role

When constructing a context brief, include only the sections the role needs:

| Role | Load from steering/ |
|---|---|
| analyst | `tech.md`, `structure.md`, `product.md` |
| designer | `tech.md`, `structure.md` |
| architect | `tech.md`, `structure.md`, `product.md` |
| coder | `tech.md`, `structure.md` |
| tester_generator_a | `tech.md` |
| tester_generator_b | `tech.md` |
| tester_arbiter | `tech.md` |
| tester_consolidator | `tech.md` |
| release_documenter | `tech.md`, `structure.md` |
| build_verifier | `tech.md` |
| deployer | `tech.md`, deploy section of `agent-config.yml` |
| delivery_manager | `tech.md` |

Every role also receives: `CONTEXT.md` and its own `steering/roles/[role].md`.

## Knowledge Base at Activation Time

Read `knowledge_base/index.md` only when a role is about to be activated — load the top matching lessons filtered by role tag into that role's context brief. Do not load all lessons at session start.

## Role Activation Protocol

Read `agent-config.yml` and determine the execution path by checking `roles.[role].provider` (defaulting to `default_provider` if absent).

**Path A — Anthropic provider** (`provider: anthropic` or provider absent):

Read `steering/roles/[role].md` and prepend its content to the context brief. Spawn the role as a Claude Code subagent using the Agent tool with these parameters:
- `model:` — exact value of `roles.[role].model` from `agent-config.yml`
- `isolation: worktree` — only when role is `coder` AND `pipeline.worktree_isolation: true` in `agent-config.yml`; omit otherwise
- `prompt:` — the full context brief constructed as:
  - Role guide from `steering/roles/[role].md` (prepended)
  - Relevant sections from `pipeline/[run]/state.md` as defined in the role's output contract
  - The following fields:
    - **Role:** [role name]
    - **Skill to invoke:** /[skill name]
    - **Read from state.md:** [exact sections]
    - **Write to state.md:** [exact section]
    - **Your output:** [what must be produced — be specific]
    - **Model:** [from agent-config.yml roles.[role].model]
    - **Tools available:** [from agent-config.yml roles.[role].tools]
    - **Active guardrails:** [any hard_block rules from guardrails.yaml applicable to this role]
    - **Lessons from prior runs:** [top matching lessons from knowledge_base/lessons/distilled/ filtered by role tag]

After the subagent completes, read the output from `pipeline/[run]/state.md` under the role's declared output-contract section. If that section is absent or its status field is not in a terminal state, treat the activation as failed and apply retry logic per the relevant retry cap. Never rely on the subagent's return value as the authoritative output.

Append one row to `pipeline/[run]/log.md` (see schema in `steering/tech.md`):
- `model_used` — exact model string from `agent-config.yml roles.[role].model`
- `provider` — `anthropic`
- `status` — `ok` on success, `error` on failure

**Path B — Cross-provider** (`provider` is any value other than `anthropic`):

Write the context brief to `pipeline/[run]/[role]_context_brief.md`, then invoke via Bash:

```
python3 scripts/call_provider.py \
  --role [role] \
  --run [run] \
  --context-file pipeline/[run]/[role]_context_brief.md
```

`call_provider.py` writes output to `state.md` and appends the log row. Read results from `state.md` after the script exits 0. If the script exits non-zero, apply retry logic. Do not spawn an Agent tool call for cross-provider roles.

**Parallel execution** (when `pipeline.parallel_execution: true`):

When the Architect flags two or more tasks as independent (no dependency edges between them), emit all their Agent tool calls in a single response message — do not send them sequentially across multiple turns. `tester_generator_a` (Path A) and `tester_generator_b` (Path B) are always spawned together in the same turn regardless of task dependency flags.

## What to provide per role activation

- **Role:** [role name]
- **Skill to invoke:** /[skill name]
- **Read from state.md:** [exact sections]
- **Write to state.md:** [exact section]
- **Your output:** [what must be produced — be specific]
- **Model:** [from agent-config.yml]
- **Tools available:** [from agent-config.yml]
- **Active guardrails:** [hard_block rules from guardrails.yaml for this role and role: all]
- **Lessons from prior runs:** [top matching lessons from knowledge_base/lessons/distilled/ filtered by role tag]
- **Shared vocabulary:** [content of CONTEXT.md — always included]
- **Steering sections:** [per the Steering Sections Per Role table — load only what this role needs]

## Acceptance criteria covered
- AC1: Anthropic role Agent tool call model: = roles.[role].model
- AC2: Cross-provider role → call_provider.py via Bash, no Agent call
- AC5: Path A log row written by orchestrator with model_used + provider
- AC7: Independent tasks spawned in single message turn
- AC8: tester_generator_a + tester_generator_b always same turn
- AC9: Coder uses isolation: worktree when worktree_isolation: true; omitted when false
- AC10: Orchestrator reads from state.md output-contract section only
